									After learning how to write our first lines of C code, we can now learn about the different types of data that can be stored in C. In C, 
									developers are able to store values inside variables. Variables are basically a container which store values. These values can then later be used
									in code. In the last post, we have been introduced to integers and strings, but there are more data types in C. In this post, we will be going through
									a few more essential data types in C. These include floats, doubles, characters and arrays. But before we are able to understand how these data types 
									are different, we must understand how C stores data to the computer. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Firstly, C stores data into a computer's memory. Memory is where a computer stores data that is going to be handled in the near future. When a program
									is run, the computer allocates memory to the program, and the data needed for the program is stored in the memory. Computers run of a binary system,
									meaning that they operate with a base 2 system. All data stored in computers is done with just ones and zeros. How you might ask? For example, if the 
									computer would like to store a number, they are able to do that with the binary counting system. The decimal system, which we use to count, 
									has digits increasing in base 10. This means that each digit is 10 times the value of the digit to its right. The binary system is similar, but instead of
									10 times more the value, it is 2 times the value. For example, if we would like to write 7 in binary, we would write 111. This is as the first digit on the right is 
									worth one, the middle digit is worth two and the left digit is worth four. One, two and four add up to seven. This is how computers store numbers, but how do they store 
									characters? This is where the ASCII comes in. ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII is a set of codes that allow computers to store characters 
									and represent text. Each character has a corresponding ASCII code, and the computer use ASCII to represent characters by using the binary numbers that correspond with the ASCII code.

								<p>
									To use C to print out a string (a sequence or "string" of characters) we must first include the stdio header file, as the printf function exists in the header file. 
									A header file is a file with functions that have already been written, and we can use them in our code. The previous blog has talked about the compilation of C code. 
									The contents of header files are included to our code by the preprocessor, allowing us to use the functions in the header file.
									stdio is a shortened version of standard input/output. It usually comes pre-installed with C compilers, so we donâ€™t have to worry about installing it.
									Standard input output generally means being able to take input from the keyboard and outputting to the screen.  
									To include the header file, include this line of code at the top of your file:
									<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code></pre>
								</p>
								<p>
									#include is an instruction for the preprocessor, telling it that we must include the contents of the specified file into our code. 
									&lt;stdio.h&gt; is the name of the file that we are including. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Next, we will write the main function. The main function is where code first starts running, and all C programs must have a main function. 
									Inside the main function, we will write the code that we want to be run.  
									To write the main function, we write this code:
									<pre><code>int main(){
    // Code we want to run:

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
									To start, the "int" part of the code means that the main function will be returning an integer value. This means that the 
									function should spit us a number when it is completed running. Next, main is the name of the function we are running. The normal brackets next to 
									are indicating that the function is not taking arguments, meaning that the main function does not need any external input to run. The curly braces 
									encapsulate what we would like to run inside the function. The "//" is a comment, and anything after the "//" is ignored by the machine when it is compiling. 
									Comments help developers understand and read code. The "return 0;" line is the last line of the function, and it tells the function to return the number 0 when it is done running.
									This line is not explicitly necessary however, as the function will return 0 by default when it is done running.
								</p>
								<p>
									Now that we have initialised the main function, we can write the code that we want to run. To print a string, we use the printf function.
									This function outputs characters to the screen. Now to type Hello World!, we write
									<pre><code>printf("Hello World!");</code></pre>
									The semicolon at the end of this line of code is necessary, as it signals to the compiler that this instruction is complete. The double apostrophes are to signal the string we want to print. 
									Now you have learnt how to write your very first lines C code! Practice by writing the code to print Hello World! below!
								</p>
								<form id="myForm">
									<label for="answer">Although C compilers will compile the same, it is good practice to have an indentation for lines of code inside a function, which is equivalent to 4 spaces. 
										Remeber to do this for your code. Do not put white spaces where there are none in the examples, and do not include any comments. 
									</label>
									<textarea id="answer" name="answer" placeholder="Type your answer here!"></textarea>
									<input type="submit" value="Submit">
								</form>
								<script>
									document.getElementById('myForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent the form from submitting normally

    var input = document.getElementById('answer').value.replace(/\r\n/g, '\n').trim();
    var correctAnswer = 
`
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    printf("Hello World!");
}
`.trim();

    if (input === correctAnswer) {
        alert('Correct!');
    } else {
        alert('Incorrect. Try again.');
    }
});
