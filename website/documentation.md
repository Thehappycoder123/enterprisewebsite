## Project Proposal
This website is designed to provide users with a basic education of the C programming language. On the internet, there are many tutorials on how to learn the C programming language, however usually these courses are large and hard to digest, or they are paid for. Also, tutorials do not always provide practice problems which means that users are not able to try and apply what they have learnt. This website is to designed to be a solution to beginners who have no idea on how to code, and have had no experience in thinking in the style of computer science. Furthermore, this website will provide a simple run down on the syntax required to make legal C code. This will be done through digestable pages of content, allowing users to absorb the information at their own pace, with actionable steps so that learners stay engaged, and improving user experience. Including alt text will help with people who are visually impaired in terms of colourblindness.
