## Project Proposal
This website is designed to provide users with a basic education of the C programming language. On the internet, there are many tutorials on how to learn the C programming language, however usually these courses are large and hard to digest, as they include large amounts of computer science jargon, or they are paid for. Also, tutorials do not always provide practice problems which means that users are not able to try and apply what they have learnt. This website is to designed to be a solution to beginners who have no idea on how to code, and have had no experience in thinking in the style of computer science. Furthermore, this website will provide a simple run down on the syntax required to make legal C code. This will be done through digestable pages of content, allowing users to absorb the information at their own pace, with actionable steps so that learners stay engaged, and improving user experience.

## Accessibility Features
Including alt text will help with people who are visually impaired. This will be easy to implement as HTML documents have a built in alt attribute, and users who use screen readers will have the alt text describing the image read out to them. To further help with accessibility, the website is entirely entirely accessible via keyboard, and users who are unable to use a mouse can navigate the pages with relative ease. This will be possible as most web browsers allows users to navigate websites using the TAB buttonand "click" on buttons with enter, and also with the menus made to be easy to navigate with keyboard only. 

## Website Hosting Solution
To host my website, I have decided to set up the domain and webserver, instead of using a third party provider, like Wix or Squarespace. This is due to multiple advantages, like more control over 

## Information gathering
The information that is on the website is based on tutorials from a multitude of websites, including w3schools and Harvard's CS50 course. 

## Coding Process
To get me started on the process of creating a webpage, I downloaded a premade html template from HTML5UP to get myself started with a blog post style website. 

## Reflection
To start, choosing to write the website's code by hand instead of utilising a no-code solution may have cause me to lose time and may have caused me to produce a less aesthetically pleasing website. This is due to my lack of experience in HTML. However, the advantages of editing the HTML document manually were quite significant. I was able to learn a lot more about frontend website programming languages, like HTML, CSS and Javascript. Furthermore, due to the fact that my hosting solution is my personal domain and web server, I am able to have much more control on where the files go on the web server, making it much easier for me to maintain the website in the future. 

Due to the fact that the theme of my website is teaching people about the C programming language, a challenge was maintaining enough white space to ensure good user experience. This is because there is a lot of information on each of the pages, and blocks of text will decrease user engagement. 

The user interface was made to be as easy to navigate as possible.
