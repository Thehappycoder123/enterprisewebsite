								<p>The computer programming language C was one of the earliest programming languages created. Developed by American computer scientist Dennis M. Ritchie at Bell Laboratories in the early 1970s, it was actually first designed for writing operating systems for minicomputers. It was based on an early programming language called "Combined Programming Language", which was first condensed into another language called B. </p>

								<p>C is considered a low-level programming language, meaning that the process of turning C code written by humans into machine code readable and executable by computers is very short, requiring little steps. Firstly, the code is passed through a preprocessor, which removes comments. These are lines of codes that developers put inside their code in order for code to be easier to understand and more readable. Next, the preprocessor looks for any file inclusion instructions, meaning that it will look for instructions in the code that ask for the contents of other files to be included. This is to import functions (a chunk of code is stored for regular reuse) written by developers that you can use in your code. Following, a compiler turns the C code into Assembly, an even older language and an even lower-level language. The compiler also optimises the code, to make it run as smoothly and efficiently as possible. Once this is complete, the assembler turns the assembly code into 1s and 0s readable by the computer, called machine code. Finally a linker links everything into one executable file. Although it seems like there are already a lot of steps from human code to machine code, it is actually very few steps in terms of programming languages. Languages like Python and Javascript require many more steps to be executable by the computer. </p>

									Despite this, C code is still very easily readable and the language strikes a good balance between computer efficiency and human readability. 
									This factor combined with the fact that C was designed for system programming, meant that it was a perfect fit to write UNIX, an early operating system 
									that introduced groundbreaking features that are still used today. The UNIX operating system eventually
									 led to the development of Linux, a versatile and open source operating system that is used in many systems today.</p>

									Now how would a computer know if you are trying to just store a number or a character? 
									In C, we must specify what sort of data we want to store in memory. This is where data types come in. 
									Data types specify to the computer what sort of data the binary code represents. Firstly, an integer is a number stored by the 
									computer. This means that the binary for the integer is just the binary equivalent of the integer specified. Each digit in the 
									binary number representing the integer is one bit. A bit is the smallest unit of data in a computer, and it can only be a 0 or a 1.
									An integer is assigned 32 bits or 4 bytes in memory (8 bits = 1 byte). This means that it has 32 spots to store a binary nubmer. 
									This these 32 spots, it its able to store a number from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. A long integer is an integer but 
									it is assigned 64 bits in memory or 8 bytes. This means that it is able to store a number from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
									Next, a float is a number with a decimal point. It is assigned 32 bits in memory or 4 bytes. However, if developers
									require more accurate decimals, they are able to utilise doubles, which allocates double the amount of memory. Characters store a single character, and 
									strings store a sequence of characters. 
								</p>
								<p>
									To store these forms of data, we must put the data type before the variable name. For example, 
									<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){
    int variable1 = 5; // variable1 will be storing an integer
    long variable2 = 922337203685477580; // variable2 will be storing a long integer
    float variable3 = 3.14; // variable3 will be storing a float
    double variable4 = 3.14159265359; // variable4 will be storing a double
    char variable5 = 'a'; // variable5 will be storing a character
}</code></pre>
								</p>
								<p>
									Notice how we could store strings in a variable? This is due to C's lack of the string data type. To store strings inside a variable, there is a 
									workaround. This involves arrays, which are a sequenced of variables. However, arrays are a topic for another post. 
								</p>

								<label>Quick Quiz! What would I write if I would like to store a decimal number with 2 decimal places in a variable?</label>
								<div>
									<input type="checkbox" id="webDevelopment" name="answer" value="A">
									<label for="webDevelopment">A: float variable = 3.14;</label>
								</div>
								<div>
									<input type="checkbox" id="osWriting" name="answer" value="B">
									<label for="osWriting">B: int variable = 3.14;</label>
								</div>
								<script>
									var checkboxes = document.getElementsByName('answer');
								
									for (var i = 0; i < checkboxes.length; i++) {
										checkboxes[i].addEventListener('change', function(event) {
											if (this.checked) {
												for (var j = 0; j < checkboxes.length; j++) {
													if (checkboxes[j] !== this) {
														checkboxes[j].disabled = true;
													}
												}
								
												setTimeout(function() {
													if (event.target.value === 'A') { // Check for the value of the checkbox
														alert('Correct!');
													} else {
														alert('Incorrect. Try again.');
													}
												}, 100);
											}
										});
