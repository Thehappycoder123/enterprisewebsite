									Operators are symbols that tell the computer to perform operations on data. There are many types of operators in C, 
									however, they are mostly quite intuitive. Firstly, there are arithmetic operators. These are the operators that you would
									use to perform arithmetic operations. Below is a table of the arithmetic operators in C.
								</p>
								<div class="table-wrapper">
									<table class="alt">
										<thead>
											<tr>
												<th>Operator</th>
												<th>Description</th>
											</tr>
										</thead>
										<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td>+</td>
												<td>Adds ints, floats, doubles and longs</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>-</td>
												<td>Minuses ints, floats, doubles and longs</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>*</td>
												<td>Multiplies ints, floats, doubles and longs</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>/</td>
												<td>Divides ints, floats, double and longs</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>%</td>
												<td>
													Named modulo operator, outputs remainder of division of two numbers. (5 % 2 = 1)
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>++</td>
												<td>
													This operator increments the value of a variable by 1.
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>--</td>
												<td>
													This operator decrements the value of a variable by 1.
												</td>
											</tr>
										</tbody>
									</table>
								</div>
								<p>
									Now we have learnt the arithmetic operators, we can move on to the relational operators. These operators are used to compare two values. 
									These values return Booleans, meaning true (1) or false (0). These help us find comparisons and then allows us to make decisions based on these comparisons.
								</p>
								<div class="table-wrapper">
									<table class="alt">
										<thead>
											<tr>
												<th>Operator</th>
												<th>Description</th>
											</tr>
										</thead>
										<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td>==</td>
												<td>Checks if values are equal</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>!=</td>
												<td>Checks if values are NOT equal</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>></td>
												<td>Checks if first value is greater than the second (9>3)</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>&lt;</td>
												<td>Checks if first value is lesser than the</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>%</td>
												<td>
													Named modulo operator, outputs remainder of division of two numbers. (5 % 2 = 1)
												</td>
											</tr>
											</tr>
										</tbody>
									</table>
								</div>
								<p>
									The last two operators have variants where you can add an equal symbol (=) after the operater to check for greater than/lesser than OR equal to. This
									is important to note as if the two values are equal the comparison operation will return true. Next there are assignment operaters. 
									These operators are used to assign values to variables.
								</p>
								<div class="table-wrapper">
									<table class="alt">
										<thead>
											<tr>
												<th>Operator</th>
												<th>Description</th>
											</tr>
										</thead>
										<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td>+=</td>
												<td>Adds a specified number to the variable (x+=7 is the same as x = x + 7)</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>-=</td>
												<td>Minuses a specified number to the variable (x-=5 is the same as x = x - 5)</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>*=</td>
												<td>Multiplies a specified number to the variable (x*=2 is the same as x = x * 2)</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>/=</td>
												<td>Divids a specified number to the variable (x/=4 is the same as x = x/4)</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>%=</td>
												<td>
													Applies modulo with a specified number to a variable (x%=3 is the same as x = x % 3)
												</td>
											</tr>
											</tr>
										</tbody>
									</table>
								</div>
								<p>
									There are a few more of these assignment operators, however they are a little bit more advanced
									and may be difficult for beginners to understand. If you are curious, you can check out 
									<a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_operators.php">this link</a> from w3schools, where you can try 
									these operators out. There are also logical operators. These operators are used to find the logic between two values. 
								</p>
								<div class="table-wrapper">
									<table class="alt">
										<thead>
											<tr>
												<th>Operator</th>
												<th>Description</th>
											</tr>
										</thead>
										<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td>&&</td>
												<td>Logical AND operator (returns 1 (true) if both values are true e.g. if x = 3, x > 1 %% x &lt; 5, this would return true)</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>||</td>
												<td>Logical OR operator (returns 1 (true) if ONE value are true e.g. if x = 3, x &lt; 1 || x &lt; 5, this would return true)</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>!</td>
												<td>Logical NOT operator (returns 1 (true) if logic is not true e.g. x = 3, !(x = 3) would return true as x does equal c, however the logic is reversed from the operator</td>
											</tr>
										</tbody>
									</table>

									Despite this, C code is still very easily readable and the language strikes a good balance between computer efficiency and human readability. 
									This factor combined with the fact that C was designed for system programming, meant that it was a perfect fit to write UNIX, an early operating system 
									that introduced groundbreaking features that are still used today. The UNIX operating system eventually
									 led to the development of Linux, a versatile and open source operating system that is used in many systems today.</p>
								<p>
									Now how would a computer know if you are trying to just store a number or a character? 
									In C, we must specify what sort of data we want to store in memory. This is where data types come in. 
									Data types specify to the computer what sort of data the binary code represents. Firstly, an integer is a number stored by the 
									computer. This means that the binary for the integer is just the binary equivalent of the integer specified. Each digit in the 
									binary number representing the integer is one bit. A bit is the smallest unit of data in a computer, and it can only be a 0 or a 1.
									An integer is assigned 32 bits or 4 bytes in memory (8 bits = 1 byte). This means that it has 32 spots to store a binary nubmer. 
									This these 32 spots, it its able to store a number from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. A long integer is an integer but 
									it is assigned 64 bits in memory or 8 bytes. This means that it is able to store a number from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
									Next, a float is a number with a decimal point. It is assigned 32 bits in memory or 4 bytes. However, if developers
									require more accurate decimals, they are able to utilise doubles, which allocates double the amount of memory. Characters store a single character, and 
									strings store a sequence of characters.
